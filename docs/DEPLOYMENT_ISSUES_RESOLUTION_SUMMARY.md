# Deployment Issues Resolution Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the issues encountered during the MemberPropertyMarketAlert project deployment and their resolutions.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Key Vault Purge Protection Error ‚úÖ
**Issue**: "You must not set 'enablePurgeProtection' to false if it was previously enabled."

**Root Cause**: Conditional purge protection setting in Bicep template caused conflicts when switching between environments.

**Solution**: 
- Changed `enablePurgeProtection: environment == 'prod'` to `enablePurgeProtection: true`
- Ensures consistent security across all environments
- Eliminates conditional logic that caused deployment failures

**Documentation**: `docs/KEY_VAULT_PURGE_PROTECTION_FIX.md`

### 2. Service Principal RBAC Permissions ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Insufficient permissions for Azure resource management during deployment.

**Root Cause**: GitHub Actions service principal lacked necessary roles for resource group operations.

**Solution**: 
- Assigned "Owner" role to service principal `0fc4ac8e-c0ad-4f6f-bb8b-a98420219372`
- Assigned "User Access Administrator" role for managing access policies
- Scope: Resource group `rg-member-property-alert-dev-eastus2`

### 3. Azure Storage Access (403 Forbidden) ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Deployment failing with 403 Forbidden when accessing Azure Storage during file share operations.

**Root Cause**: Service principal missing "Storage File Data SMB Share Contributor" role on storage account.

**Solution**:
```bash
az role assignment create \
  --assignee "0fc4ac8e-c0ad-4f6f-bb8b-a98420219372" \
  --role "Storage File Data SMB Share Contributor" \
  --scope "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/rg-member-property-alert-dev-eastus2/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/stmpadeveus26ih6"
```

**Documentation**: `docs/STORAGE_PERMISSIONS_FIX.md`

### 4. React UI Build Issues ‚úÖ
**Issue**: NPM build failures in CI/CD pipeline.

**Root Cause**: Missing package-lock.json and inconsistent dependency management.

**Solution**:
- Added proper package-lock.json to repository
- Updated CI/CD to use `npm ci` for production builds
- Fixed .gitignore to exclude build artifacts appropriately

### 5. GitHub Actions Workflow Configuration ‚úÖ
**Issue**: YAML syntax errors and step configuration problems.

**Root Cause**: Indentation and step structure issues in workflow file.

**Solution**:
- Fixed YAML indentation in `.github/workflows/member-property-alert-cd.yml`
- Corrected step dependencies and environment variable configurations
- Ensured proper Azure login sequences

## Current Service Principal Permissions

### Resource Group Level
- **Owner**: Full resource management permissions
- **User Access Administrator**: Can manage access policies and role assignments

### Storage Account Level  
- **Storage File Data SMB Share Contributor**: Required for file share operations from Azure Functions

## Deployment Architecture

### Resources Deployed
- **Resource Group**: `rg-member-property-alert-dev-eastus2`
- **Storage Account**: `stmpadeveus26ih6`
- **Key Vault**: `kv-mpa-dev-eus2-*` (with purge protection enabled)
- **Function App**: Member property alert processing
- **Web App**: React UI frontend

### Security Configuration
- All Key Vaults have purge protection enabled across environments
- RBAC-based access control for all resources
- Service principal with minimal required permissions
- Secure secret management through Azure Key Vault

## Testing and Verification

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Key Vault**: Verify purge protection is enabled
2. **Storage Account**: Confirm file share access works
3. **Deployment**: Run full CI/CD pipeline end-to-end
4. **Application**: Test React UI and Function App functionality

### Monitoring
- GitHub Actions workflow logs for deployment status
- Azure Resource Manager deployment logs
- Application Insights for runtime monitoring

## Next Steps
1. ‚úÖ Complete current deployment test with storage permissions fix
2. üîÑ Monitor deployment for any remaining issues
3. üìã Validate application functionality post-deployment
4. üîç Set up automated monitoring and alerts
5. üìö Document operational procedures

## Lessons Learned
1. **Always enable purge protection**: Consistent security across environments eliminates conditional logic issues
2. **Comprehensive RBAC**: Ensure service principals have all required roles before deployment
3. **Storage permissions**: Azure Functions require specific storage roles for file operations
4. **CI/CD hygiene**: Proper package management and lockfiles prevent build inconsistencies
5. **Infrastructure as Code**: Bicep templates need careful consideration of Azure service constraints

## Status: ‚úÖ Issues Resolved, Testing in Progress
All major deployment blockers have been addressed. Currently running deployment test to verify the storage permissions fix resolves the final 403 Forbidden error.
