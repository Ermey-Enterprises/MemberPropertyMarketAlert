# React App Serving Fix

## Issue
The web app was displaying the generic Azure App Service page ("Your web app is running and waiting for your content") instead of the React admin dashboard application.

## Root Cause
The ASP.NET Core application was not properly configured to serve the React build files from the correct location. The static file middleware was not pointing to the build directory where the compiled React app resides.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Program.cs (v1.0.2)
- Added `Microsoft.Extensions.FileProviders` using statement
- Configured `UseStaticFiles()` with `StaticFileOptions` to serve files from the `build` directory
- Updated `MapFallbackToFile()` to use the same `StaticFileOptions` for proper React Router support
- Maintained fallback to `wwwroot` for any additional static files

### 2. Updated Project File (.csproj)
- Fixed the `RelativePath` in the `PublishRunWebpack` target to properly map build files
- Added `CopyBuildFiles` target to ensure build files are available during local development
- Ensured proper file structure preservation during deployment

## Key Changes Made

### Program.cs Changes:
```csharp
// Configure static files to serve React build files
app.UseStaticFiles(new StaticFileOptions
{
    FileProvider = new PhysicalFileProvider(
        Path.Combine(builder.Environment.ContentRootPath, "build")),
    RequestPath = ""
});

// Serve React app for all non-API routes
app.MapFallbackToFile("index.html", new StaticFileOptions
{
    FileProvider = new PhysicalFileProvider(
        Path.Combine(builder.Environment.ContentRootPath, "build"))
});
```

### Project File Changes:
- Fixed `RelativePath` to `build\%(RecursiveDir)%(Filename)%(Extension)`
- Added `CopyBuildFiles` target for local development support

## Expected Result
After deployment, the web app should display the React admin dashboard with:
- Navigation header with "Member Property Alert - Admin Dashboard"
- Connection status indicator
- Dashboard and Institutions navigation tabs
- Scan controls and log viewer components
- Proper React Router functionality

## Deployment
- Changes committed: `034b8e7`
- Pushed to main branch
- GitHub Actions workflow will handle the deployment
- Monitor the deployment pipeline for successful completion

## Verification Steps
1. Wait for GitHub Actions deployment to complete
2. Navigate to the Azure web app URL
3. Verify React dashboard loads instead of generic Azure page
4. Test navigation between Dashboard and Institutions tabs
5. Verify static assets (CSS, JS) load correctly
