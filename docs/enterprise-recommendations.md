# Enterprise-Grade Recommendations

The following recommendations expand on the desired tenant administration, SSO onboarding, and property scanning capabilities for MemberPropertyMarketAlert. They are grouped by discipline so the engineering team can prioritize workstreams aligned with enterprise expectations.

## 1. Architecture & Multitenancy
- Separate control plane (global admin) and tenant plane (per-tenant operations) into different services or Azure Function apps. Enforce tenant isolation at the persistence layer by partitioning Cosmos DB containers on tenant ID and avoiding shared documents that mix configuration and address data.
- Introduce a dedicated tenant entity model that tracks provisioning status, environment, last scan timestamps, and SSO configuration state so orchestration and UI flows can reason about tenant lifecycle.
- Implement infrastructure-as-code (Bicep/Terraform) for all Azure resources to guarantee reproducible environments, secure defaults, and observability wiring (diagnostic settings, log analytics).

## 2. Identity & Access Management
- Replace API-key authentication with Azure AD (Entra) backed tokens. Use separate enterprise applications for the admin portal and per-tenant SSO integrations. Store SAML/OIDC metadata (entity IDs, certificates, redirect URIs) securely in Key Vault and expose configuration wizards in the UI.
- Layer role-based access control (RBAC) on top of tenant authentication. Recommended roles: tenant owner, tenant editor, read-only tenant viewer, platform admin, and support engineer. Enforce these roles in API authorization policies and front-end feature toggles.
- Require audit logging of authentication and authorization decisions, including failed login attempts, administrative impersonation events, and SSO metadata changes.

## 3. Data Management & API Design
- Use continuation tokens (`FeedIterator`) for Cosmos queries instead of OFFSET/LIMIT. Implement optimistic concurrency (ETags) and soft-delete markers to prevent lost updates and support recovery.
- Normalize addresses (USPS/CASS, geocoding) prior to persistence to ensure matching accuracy. Capture validation errors and surface them in the UI during CSV uploads.
- Build a robust CSV ingestion pipeline that supports append vs. replace semantics, performs duplicate detection, and allows bulk validation previews before committing changes.

## 4. Scanning & RentCast Integration
- Persist scan cursors (last successful scan per tenant, pagination tokens) so RentCast requests can query only newly listed properties. Include retry/backoff strategies that respect RentCast API quotas and handle transient failures.
- Design idempotent match processing that deduplicates property notifications across scans and tenants. Consider durable orchestration (Azure Durable Functions/Container Apps) for long-running scan workflows.
- Surface configurable scan schedules per tenant in the admin portal, and expose health dashboards for recent scans, success rates, and throttling incidents.

## 5. Security & Compliance
- Store secrets (Cosmos connection strings, Service Bus credentials, SSO certificates) exclusively in Azure Key Vault and access them via managed identities. Rotate credentials automatically using Key Vault rotation policies.
- Enable encryption at rest for Cosmos DB and consider client-side encryption for sensitive tenant datasets. Document data retention, deletion, and export processes to satisfy GDPR/CCPA.
- Conduct threat modeling on tenant onboarding, SSO flows, and CSV ingestion to mitigate injection, replay, and privilege escalation risks.

## 6. Observability & Operations
- Standardize structured logging (tenant ID, correlation ID, request ID) and enrich telemetry with key business metrics: addresses uploaded, matches found, notifications sent. Integrate dashboards and alerting via Azure Monitor/App Insights.
- Implement audit trails for administrative actions (tenant creation, SSO updates, schedule changes) and expose reports downloadable by compliance teams.
- Add automated accessibility, end-to-end UI, and API contract tests. Integrate these with CI/CD pipelines to block regressions and ensure continuous compliance.

## 7. Frontend & User Experience
- Build the React administration portal using an enterprise-ready component library (e.g., Fluent UI). Provide data grids for address management, CSV upload modals with validation summaries, and SSO configuration wizards with metadata previews.
- Support localization, accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), and responsive layouts. Add inline help and contextual documentation for tenant administrators.
- Provide notification configuration screens allowing multiple email recipients, escalation policies, and integration with webhooks or Teams/Slack.

## 8. DevSecOps & Delivery
- Establish CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions/Azure DevOps) that run unit/integration tests, linting, SAST/DAST scans, dependency checks, and IaC validation before deploying to segregated dev/test/prod environments.
- Implement deployment strategies (blue/green or canary) for the Functions app and web frontend to reduce downtime. Automate smoke tests post-deployment and provide rollback tooling.
- Monitor supply-chain risk by locking dependencies, scanning container images, and documenting upgrade cadences.

These actions will move the platform toward the enterprise-grade standards required for multi-tenant property alert management while maintaining security, scalability, and operational excellence.
